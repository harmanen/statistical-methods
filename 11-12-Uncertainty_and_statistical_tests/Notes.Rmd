# Introduction

These notes consider Chapters 11 (statistical models and dealing with uncertainty) and 12 (statistical tests and hypothesis testing) of the [handbook](https://emotion.utu.fi/tilastotiede/). These chapters are more theoretical with little code examples so I decided to combine them. There are, however, some formulae and concepts worth writing down.
