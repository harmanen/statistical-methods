# Statistical methods

This repository follows the structure of the first edition of the handbook on statistical methods ([Tilastotieteen k√§sikirja](https://www.tammi.fi/kirja/lauri-nummenmaa/tilastotieteen-kasikirja/9789520401382)) by [Lauri Nummenmaa (PhD)](https://emotion.utu.fi/people/) who is the head of the [Nummenmaa lab](https://emotion.utu.fi/) at [Turku PET centre](https://turkupetcentre.fi/), [University of Turku](https://www.utu.fi). 

Instructions on how to install the custom datasets package and the original code snippets can be found [here](https://emotion.utu.fi/tilastotiede/) (in Finnish).

Note that these are mainly my own personal notes so it is probably impossible to study these concepts just based on the materials found here. **I would strongly recommend to get the book if studying is your goal!** Furthermore, I have pulled additional explanations and formulae from other sources (mainly Wikipedia) to fill some gaps on the theoretical side that I feel are useful.
