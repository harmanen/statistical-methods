These notes consider the Chapter 10 of the [handbook](https://emotion.utu.fi/tilastotiede/) on various probability distributions.

# Discrete distributions

For random variables with countable number of possible values.

## Binomial distribution

See page 200 for proper definition.

```{=latex}
Useful when a random variable $X$ has exactly two exclusive possible outcomes (e.g. success/fail) with known probabilities $p\in[0,1]$ (success) and $q=1-p$ (fail). For $n\in\mathbb{N}$ trials with $k=0,1,2,\dots ,n$ successes

\begin{displaymath}
X\sim Bin(n,p)
\end{displaymath}

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{P}(X=k)=\binom{n}{k}p^kq^{n-k}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{F}(k)=\mathrm{P}(X\leqslant k)=\sum_{i=0}^k\binom{n}{i}p^iq^{n-i}
\end{equation}

In the following code examples, equal probabilities are assumed, $n=$ \textbf{size}, $p=$ \textbf{prob} $=0.5$.
```

```{r out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
# Sequence for visualization
seq <- seq(0, 25, by=1)

# Functions
binomial_density_function <- dbinom(x = seq, size = 25, prob = 0.5)
binomial_distribution_function <- pbinom(q = seq, size = 25, prob = 0.5)

# Plot
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(seq, binomial_density_function, ann = FALSE)
plot(seq, binomial_distribution_function, type = "S", ann = FALSE)
```
```{r out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
# Probability for exactly 3 successes out of 10 trials
dbinom(x = 3, size = 10, prob = 0.5)

# Probability for up to 3 successes out of 10 trials
pbinom(q = 3, size = 10, prob = 0.5)

# Simulate 10 times how many successes there is using random numbers
rbinom(n = 10, size = 10, prob = 0.5)

# With large enough n, expected value (np = 5) should become visible
rbinom500 <- rbinom(n = 500, size = 10, prob = 0.5)
hist(rbinom500, xlab = "Number of successes", ylab = "Frequency", main = NULL)
summary(rbinom500)
